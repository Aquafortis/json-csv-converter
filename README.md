## JSON TO CSV - CSV TO JSON

A lightweight conversion tool for converting `json` to `csv`, or `csv` to `json`.

**Usage:**

Paste the `json` you want to convert into the `input.json` file.

Read results in `output.csv` file.

Paste the `csv` you want to convert into the `input.csv` file.

Read results in `output.json` file.

**Run:**

`$ cd (path to json-csv-converter folder)`

`$ python3 jsontocsv.py`

`$ python3 csvtojson.py`

**Drag and Drop Version:**

You'll find a standalone version in the `JsonCsv` folder.

This script can be run in situ or from any directory simply by copying the `convert.py` file to that directory, i.e., your Desktop.

* This script only works with `python 3x`
* Script uses user inputs with instructions
* Output files are generated in same directory
* Use `ctrl` + `C` or `ctrl` + `D` etc. to exit

Don't forget to save or rename the output file if you want to keep it.

**Limitations:**

These will only convert single layer `json` arrays.
